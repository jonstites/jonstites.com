# Cowboy Bebop

Cowboy Bebop surprised me. It felt like reading thought-provoking science fiction, but the anime format allowed for just stunning visuals.

My wife commented that she wished it had "more progressive views on women." That's not the phrasing I would use, but I agree with the gist.

Classic science fiction in general has a gender and race problem. Specifically, the characters are almost always white men. Non-white or non-male characters, if they exist, usually do not read like real people.

This is one reason I am turning towards more modern science fiction. This is purely selfish - the best science fiction makes one think about society. That falls flat when the perspectives are mostly white men.
