Nate Silver's excellent [The Signal and the Noise](https://www.amazon.com/Signal-Noise-Many-Predictions-Fail-but/dp/0143125087)
has a section on the housing crisis that's worth quoting in full:

> **Risk,** as first articulated by the economist Frank H. Knight in 1921, is something that you can put a price on. Say that you'll win a poker hand unless your opponent draws to an inside straight: the chances of that happening are *exactly* 1 chance in 11. This is risk. It is not pleasant when you take a "bad beat" in poker, but at least you know the odds of it and can account for it ahead of time. In the long run, you'll make a profit from your opponents making desperate draws with insufficient odds.
>
> **Uncertainty,** on the other hand, is risk that is hard to measure. You might have some vague awareness of the demons lurking out there. You might even be acutely concerned about them. But you have no real idea how many of them there are or when they might strike. Your back-of-the-envelope estimate might be off by a factor of 100 or by a factor of 1,000; there is no good way to know. This is uncertainty. Risk greases the wheels of a free-market economy; uncertainty grinds them to a halt.

> The alchemy that the ratings agencies performed was to spin uncertainty into what looked and felt like risk. They took highly novel securities, subject to an enormous amount of systemic uncertainty, and claimed the ability to quantify just how risky they were. Not only that, but of all possible conclusions, they came to the astounding one that these investments were almost risk-free.

And in a section on weather forecasting, a description of chaos theory:
> Chaos theory applies to systems in which each of two properties hold:
>1. The systems are *dynamic,* meaning that the behavior of the system at one point in time influences its behavior in the future;
>2. And they are *nonlinear,* meaning they abide by exponential rather than additive relationships.
