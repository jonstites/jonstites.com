# Quick Thoughts

By tracking predictions across a wide-range of subjects, I hope to improve general forecasting ability.

My coronavirus predictions have been mixed - maybe better than average, but not good.

Definitions:

- low confidence - 10-40% chance
- medium confidence - 40-60% chance
- high confidence - 60-80% chance


## Wrong

Like most people, at the very beginning I under-estimated the coronavirus impact. (medium confidence)

I had modestly expected interest in finding weaker versions of the virus and attenuated vaccines. This is not happening. (low confidence)

I had expected more supply-chain issues. (low confidence)

## Right 

(or more-likely than when first predicted, anyway)

I'd been skeptical of the "don't wear mask" advice very early, in the March 1 - March 8 range. (medium confidence)

[Human-challenge trials](https://coronavirus.nautil.us/what-is-a-human-challenge-trial-and-could-it-solve-the-coronavirus-vaccine-problem/) are obviously morally-superior to conventional Phase III tests. So I had expected a rigorous public debate (check) which would be settled in their favor (unclear). (high confidence)

I'd guessed that Western countries will end up pretty close to Sweden eventually, it would just take longer to get there. This appears to be happening. (medium confidence)

I'd hoped that Sweden's approach be better for human welfare in the medium-term to long-term. I think the balance of evidence favors masks + voluntary social distancing + open schools + testing + contact tracing + banning super-spreader events + protections in nursing homes. (medium confidence)

## More predictions

The nursing-home [debacle](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/nursing-homes-coronavirus.html) (an example of banal evil?) was much more consequential than the comments by our "[very stable genius](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/very-stable-genius)" about [injecting bleach](https://twitter.com/Lysol/status/1253754559752802304/photo/1), but will ultimately generate less outrage. (high confidence)

Partial herd immunity will kick in a lot sooner than [experts claim](https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/achieving-herd-immunity-with-covid19.html) (high confidence):

- reasonable measures reduce R
- sub-population heterogeneity (concentrated among essential workers and people who just don't care enough to social distance)

But this will vary by region due to density, weather, testing capacity, etc.
