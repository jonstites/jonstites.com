Software engineer at The Home Depot working primarily doing data engineering on Google Cloud Platform. My resume has more info on my background.

Random thoughts:
  * I really love Rust. I love the ownership system, error handling, traits for inheritance, immutability by default, explicitness about what types of data are copied and when, and how easy it is to write correct, safe, high-performance, concurrent code.
  * Go is also pretty neat.
  * Big fan of board games.
  * Big fan of [books](/reading_list/).
