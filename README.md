# My Website

A place to shout into the abyss.

It is currently hosted on AWS S3 with Cloudfront for TLS/SSL support. This is a pretty sweet setup as it costs around $0.50 / month. At the time GitHub didn't support HTTPS with a custom domain (and maybe still doesn't), so I went with S3.

I use Jekyll for building the website and [minimal mistakes jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) for looking nice.
