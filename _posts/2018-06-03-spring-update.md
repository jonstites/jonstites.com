I gave myself a relatively light workload for my last semester. I did this partly because I'm lazy, but also so I could have the flexibility to work on other things. This paid off - I worked as a Data Scientist intern during the semester.

Overall, I like the strategy of having few hard commitments and lots of soft commitments. 

And I met my most important goals for the semester: acquired a Masters degree and an offer at an interesting job.
