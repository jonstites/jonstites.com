Bryan Caplan is a smart guy who thinks about interesting things, 
then writes about it for the rest of us.

Check out his book 
[The Myth of the Rational Voter](https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Rational-Voter-Democracies-Policies/dp/0691138737).
It might change how you think about democracy.
 
In it, he models human irrationality as 
"preferences over beliefs." A standard demand curve predicts
that when the cost of having irrational beliefs
is low, people hold more irrational beliefs. 

The odds of being the person to cast a decisive vote in an election
is astronomically low. So in politics:

>Beliefs that are irrational from the standpoint of truth-seeking 
are rational from the standpoint of individual utility maximization.

Read the whole book. Once you've accepted the general idea of
preferences over beliefs, you start to see it everywhere.
