From [Linux System Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-System-Programming-Talking-Directly/dp/1449339530) by Robert Love:
> The cruel irony of threads is the chain of desires begetting pain, which prompt solutions that only beget more pain. We want threads for concurrency, but that concurrency introduces race conditions. So we introduce mutexes, but those mutexes introduce a new source of programming bug: the deadlock.
