It seems to me that writing is an undervalued skill for software developers.

I believe that quality of communication can have a large impact on a team's performance.
Poor communication can lead to buggy code, sub-optimal code, duplication of effort, etc.
Effective communication can foster the spread of ideas and understanding of concepts and
code.

Since writing is important, I'm using this blog as a place to practice it. I've also picked up
a copy of [Style: Toward Clarity and Grace](https://www.amazon.com/Style-Clarity-Chicago-Writing-Publishing/dp/0226899152/)
by Joseph Williams.

Additionally, attempting to teach someone else is a great way to deeply learn about your topic.

Of course, there is also the outside possibility of writing something that is useful to other
people. If something was ever featured on the front page of Hacker News, I would be convinced that I had "made it"
as a software developer.
