I've written before that the spring 2017 semester was [pretty rough.]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-06-10-spring-post-mortem  %})

Now fall 2017 is over, it's time to reflect on how it went.

## School

Graduate school dominates my life right now. That's just the way grad school is. So my well-being is tightly coupled with my success in school.

And it went great!

Not perfect. Never perfect. But I was careful not to over-commit myself, so I had time to learn on my own. 

For example, I went to a super cool undergraduate [neural networks class](http://www.philkr.net/cs342/) just for fun, without enrolling in it.

I did make two mistakes. 

First, I powered through a class that was not very good. I should have switched classes instead. It took a substantial amount of work but I didn't really learn anything.

The other mistake was a resource allocation error. In the last week of the semester, I spent too much time to studying for class X and not enough on class Y. 

On the final for class X, I was 25 percentage points above the cutoff for an A in the class. On the final project for class Y, I was about 3 percentage points shy getting an A in the class.

An A- isn't the end of the world, though. 

## Everything Else

I didn't read as much as I would have liked. I also didn't keep up with a [deep work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) routine. 

I did keep up with an exercise routine, learned a lot about tensorflow and neural networks, and I had fun. Overall, it was a solid semester.
