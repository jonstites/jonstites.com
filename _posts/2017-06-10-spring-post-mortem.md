## Motivation

Disclaimer: I use the [f-word](http://www.npr.org/2012/06/19/155005546/failure-the-f-word-silicon-valley-loves-and-hates) repeatedly in this post.

**Failure**.

Spoiler alert: I passed all my classes. But still, in a lot of ways, spring semester was a failure for me.

This post covers what happened, why, and how I'll prevent it from happening again. It's inspired by the [bracingly honest](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/10/postmortem-of-database-outage-of-january-31/) post-mortems sometimes seen on [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com).

## Event Description

> "I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by."

My main goals were:
* take 4 computer science classes
* have a >= 3.50 GPA
* learn and retain most class material
* be a good TA
* exercise
* develop my programming skills

By the second week, I knew I was in over my head. There were too many things I wanted to do and not enough time to do them well.

I shelved my books and stopped coding for fun.

I gave up most socializing, foosball, chess, and exercise. This freed up more time, but reduced average productivity because I didn't have effective stress relief.

Next on the chopping block: learning and retaining class material. I had initially done all assigned readings, worked on homework early, and looked over lecture slides before and after class. All of this was cut.

With extreme reluctance, I skipped awesome projects on memory management, Unix shells, and file systems. This was devastating to morale: why bother going to school if I don't do the interesting, difficult projects?

Under these conditions, my stress sky-rocketed and I burned-out repeatedly. But I limped through to the end of the semester like this.

I met my goal for grades (A, A-, A-, and "pass"). My other goals weren't even close.

There was so much information in my classes that I didn't absorb due to lack of attention and time.

I was a crummy TA, and this is my biggest regret of the semester. I was very slow to return graded coursework. This is frustrating, but more importantly, people learn much better with quick, frequent feedback. The students deserved a better experience.

I didn't read any programming books or do any programming projects outside of class. And the ones I did for class weren't terribly challenging. So my most important skillset stagnated for several months.

Plus I was a couch potato. Or maybe a desk potato. Whatever. A sedentary object.

## Counter-measures

This is the important part: preventing it from ever happening again.

The main problem was that I made too many committments. 

I won't take four computer science classes at once. It was doable, it would be better to spend time on the most interesting one or two classes.

I also won't TA again. It's a fantastic deal financially... until the opportunity cost is included. This is arguably the most critical period for my career development. But TA work doesn't stretch the brain or sharpen any important skills. Verdict: not worth it.

In addition to working less, I will also work more effectively.

I am re-learning how to be bored as one method to sharpen by attention and ability to focus intensely. Last semester, I would fill spare moments with the glorious distraction of The Internet. But this trained my brain to crave it, and go into withdrawals whenever I needed to concentrate. So I am dramatically reducing my Internet consumption. I'm using my free time for reading, hobbies, exercise, friends, or even being bored. So not only will my attention improve (hopefully), but I'll do more truly important things.

I've also designated 6:45-8:45am as my "deep work" time. I only work on important, difficult projects with absolutely no distractions. Over time, I'd like to add another two hours every day.

Also, I stop working at 5:30pm. This is a hard cutoff. This gives me more time to recharge, guilt-free. It also forces me work intensely on the most important things. And to not work at all on unimportant things.

These changes should prevent anything like the "crisis of spring 2017" (as it shall be known), and, hopefully, improve the quality of my work.
