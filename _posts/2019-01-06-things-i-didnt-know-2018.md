Inspired by [this post.](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/) 

Things I'm curious about but don't know:

- **Microkernels and unikernels.** I think that microkernels are designed to have as much as possible in user-space, but a lot of kernel stuff is mysterious to me.

- **Virtual machines.** I don't know how the JVM works. I think Erlang also has a virtual machine, but I don't know if it is similar to the JVM. I don't know if there are any performance penalties.

- **Programming languages.** I don't know which languages have access to runtime type information or how runtime information is stored. I don't know how Java does generics. I don't know how exceptions are implemented in any language. I don't really know how anything in Python is represented. I don't know how type-inference is performed. I have no idea what C++ templates are. I don't know how to write Rust macros or what non-lexical lifetimes are. I don't know how Rust's HashMaps are represented.

- **Blockchain blockchain blockchain!** I kinda sorta get blockchains. Transactions are validated with public-key cryptography. A sequence of transactions is a block. There's a race among miners to find a way to hash the latest block in a special way (so it ends with several zeros?). The miner that successfully figures this out first gets a reward, and other miners have an incentive to accept it and move on.

   I don't know what proof-of-work is and how it differs from proof-of-stake. I don't know how the mimble-grimble protocol works or what eliptic-curve cryptography is. I don't know why the Bitcoin network so slow or why there is (was?) all that hype over Bitcoin. It's decentralized, but everyone seems to... have centralized mining pools? And centralized wallet stores? And it's not even anonymous - it's pseudoanoymous (right?) so everyone can see everybody else's transactions. I don't know why there is (was?) all the hype over _blockchains_ in situations where a database seems like a better option.

- **Dependencies.** How can we have access to lots of awesome, open-source software while protecting ourselves from malicious actors? Also, how are dependencies managed by the *nixes?

- **Options theory.** I know basically nothing about options theory, but it seems like some concepts could transfer over to other domains.

- **Self-driving cars.** Waze uses sophisticated hardware and has been trying to crack self-driving cars for a long time. Tesla uses regular cameras...? I don't understand why Waze seems so pessimistic about self-driving cars while Tesla seems so optimistic.
