I'm a computer science Masters student at the University of Texas at Austin.

I did my undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz. I double-majored in Cognitive Science and Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology with a minor in Bioinformatics. I had a busy 4 years! 

Then I spent 3 years at Dovetail Genomics doing bioinformatics.

Now I'm in a Masters program at UT Austin and becoming a better programmer.

I definitely love [reading](/reading_list/). I like playing boardgames, piano, gin rummy, and chess, and I'd like to take up archery in 2018.
