I'm a computer science Masters student at the University of Texas at Austin.

Ping me if you want to look at some of my private repos for code examples.

Still figuring out what it is exactly that I want to do. I've been super interested in my Computer Architecture and Organization class. But I also loved data structures, algorithms, and machine learning. And I want to get better at general software engineering. 



## Background
I did my undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz. I say I majored in Biology, but that's not quite right. I double-majored in Cognitive Science and Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology with a minor in Bioinformatics. I had a busy 4 years! 

Between undergraduate research projects, I learned Python on the side and got hooked. In retrospect, I should have dropped my Cognitive Science major and focused on learning more programming / computer science.

Through my undergraduate research, I ended up as the first employee at a genome assembly startup called Dovetail Genomics. I spent most of my time on the command line, including data analysis and working on large software projects. 

I learned a ton there. I also made a lot of good friends, and got to watch a lot of changes happen as the company grew and developed over the 3 years I was there.

Eventually I decided to bring my programming skills to the next level. Ended up at UT Austin doing a Masters. Loving it so far. The rate at which I learn has been dramatically accelerated.

## Code
I'm best at Python. I'm second best at C++. 

I can program in Java and C, although I'm slower and occasionally have to look up syntax - I'm a bit rusty. I haven't done any large projects in them, just homework and some programming on the side (e.g. Project Euler).

## Sci-Fi
Because I like sci-fi.

Favorite books include the Foundation Trilogy (Asimov), Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (Philip K. Dick), and Neuromancer (William Gibson). 

Always happy to talk sci-fi and get recommendations. 

## Other Nerd Stuff
I also love a good game of foosball.

Some favorite boardgames are Betrayal: House on the Hill, Avalon, and Netrunner.
